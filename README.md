# Car_dealership_application
As part of a group project during MS in Georgia Tech, my team built a desktop application for car dealership using PHP, , Javascript, HTML and SQL. In order to avoid plagiarism, the repo is private and please feel free to contact me to access the project code.

The project was completed in 3 phases:
1. Phase 1 involved creating EER diagram, IFD (Information Flow Diagram) diagram, identifying data types and constraints, and task decomposition with abstract code.
2. Phase 2 involved writing the SQL for abstract codes of all tasks, creating the schema for the application, and designing EER to relational mapping.
3. Phase 3 involved creating the PHP (server side scripting language) files for the application where login.php corresponds to the starting page of the car dealership application. 
4. HTML, PHP (embedded in HTML),  CSS and SQL(queries embedded into PHP)  were used to build the app. The desktop app was launched using localhost for project demo purposes.
